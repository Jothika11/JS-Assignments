//Using Conditional


// let avg=50;

  } else if (avg < 100) {
          console.log(`Marks are ${avg} and grade is A`);

//Using Switch case

// let  mark = 50;

let mark = Number(prompt("Enter your marks",0));

// Using Ternary Operators
// Syntax: conditon ? value if true : value if false

// let marks=50;
let marks = Number(prompt("Enter your marks",0));
console.log(marks >= 50 ? `Marks are ${marks} and grade is B`:`Marks are ${marks} and grade is A`);
